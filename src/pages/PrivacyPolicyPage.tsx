        <h2>1. Introduction and Scope</h2>
        <p>
          {LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME} is an unincorporated personal project operated by an individual based in
          the State of Maryland, United States. This Privacy Policy describes the types of
          information we collect from users of this web application (the &quot;Application&quot;),
          how we use and protect that information, the circumstances under which we may share it,
          and the rights you have regarding your personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy applies only to information collected through the Application itself. It
          does not apply to information collected through third-party services you use in
          connection with the Application, such as Supabase or PayPal, which have their own
          independent privacy policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          By creating an account or using the Application, you acknowledge that you have read
          and understood this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="legal-page__section">
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Account Information</h3>
        <p>
          When you create an account, we collect the following information directly from you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Email address:</strong> Used to create and authenticate your account via
            Supabase Auth. Your email is stored securely by Supabase and is not displayed
            publicly within the Application.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Display name:</strong> A name or username you provide at registration. This
            is displayed to you within the Application and may be visible to administrators.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Authentication Tokens</h3>
        <p>
          When you sign in, Supabase Auth issues a session token that is stored in your browser
          (via cookies or local storage). This token is used to maintain your authenticated
          session across page loads. We do not store or process this token independently; it
          is managed entirely by Supabase.
        </p>

        <h3>Server Log Data</h3>
        <p>
          When you access the Application, our hosting infrastructure automatically records
          standard server log data. This may include your IP address, browser type and version,
          operating system, the pages you access within the Application, referring URLs, and
          the date and time of your requests. This information is collected automatically and
          is used for security monitoring, abuse prevention, and infrastructure maintenance.
        </p>

        <h3>User-Generated Content (Administrator Accounts Only)</h3>
        <p>
          If you have been granted administrator access, any custom content you create within
          the Application (such as custom planets, custom fleets, or map modifications) is
          stored in our database together with your user ID. This association is used for
          attribution, audit logging, and accountability purposes.
        </p>

        <h3>Donation Information</h3>
        <p>
          We do not collect, receive, or store any financial or payment information. If you
          choose to make a voluntary donation through the PayPal link on our site, all payment
          processing is handled exclusively by PayPal. We have no access to your payment
          details, card numbers, bank account information, or PayPal account data.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Automatically:</strong> Server log data is collected automatically each
            time your browser makes a request to our hosting servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Through your actions in the Application:</strong> If you are an authorized
            administrator and create or modify content, that content and your user ID are
            recorded in the database.
          </li>

          <li>To create and maintain your account and verify your identity when you sign in.</li>
          <li>

          <li>To display your chosen display name within the Application.</li>
          <li>

          We do not use your information for advertising, behavioral profiling, or marketing
          of any kind. We do not build profiles about you based on your usage of the
          Application.

      <section className="legal-page__section">
        <h2>5. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell, rent, lease, or otherwise transfer your personal information to any
          third party for commercial purposes. We share your information only in the following
          limited circumstances:
        </p>

        <h3>Supabase</h3>
        <p>
          We use Supabase to provide authentication and database services for the Application.
          Your email address, display name, session data, and any user-generated content you
          create as an administrator are processed and stored by Supabase on our behalf.
          Supabase operates under its own{' '}
          <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Privacy Policy
          </a>. Supabase has its own data processing and security practices, and we encourage
          you to review their policy.
        </p>

        <h3>Hosting Provider</h3>
        <p>
          The Application is hosted through a third-party infrastructure provider. That
          provider may process server log data (such as IP addresses and access timestamps)
          in the ordinary course of providing hosting services.
        </p>

        <h3>PayPal</h3>
        <p>
          If you choose to make a voluntary donation, you interact directly with PayPal through
          their platform. We do not receive any financial or personal data from PayPal as a
          result of donations. Your use of PayPal is governed by{' '}
          <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/privacy-full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            PayPal&apos;s Privacy Policy
          </a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, court order, or
          lawful request by government authorities, or when we believe in good faith that
          disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety
          of others, investigate fraud or abuse, or comply with a legal obligation.
        </p>

        <h3>Successors</h3>
        <p>
          In the unlikely event that the Application or its assets are transferred to another
          individual or entity, user data may be included in that transfer. If this occurs,
          we will provide reasonable notice and the successor will be bound to honor this
          Privacy Policy or notify you of any material changes.

        <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          We use only essential, strictly necessary cookies. Specifically, Supabase Auth
          places a session cookie in your browser when you sign in. This cookie is required
          for the Application to function correctly; without it, you cannot maintain an
          authenticated session.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not use any of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Analytics cookies or tracking services (such as Google Analytics)</li>
          <li>Advertising or retargeting cookies</li>
          <li>Third-party tracking pixels or web beacons</li>
          <li>Social media tracking scripts</li>
          <li>Any cookies that track your behavior across other websites</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You may clear or block cookies through your browser settings at any time. Blocking
          or deleting the Supabase session cookie will sign you out of the Application and
          require you to sign in again.

        <h2>7. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
          Your account data and user-generated content are stored in a PostgreSQL database
          hosted by Supabase. Access to this database is governed by row-level security (RLS)
          policies, which ensure that each user can only access their own data. Administrator
          access is explicitly granted and logged.
        </p>
        <p>
          All data transmitted between your browser and our servers, and between our servers
          and Supabase, is protected using TLS/SSL encryption. We follow industry-standard
          security practices in our development and infrastructure configuration.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure. We
          cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. You use the Application
          at your own risk with respect to any data you choose to provide.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will
          notify affected users in compliance with the Maryland Personal Information Protection
          Act (MPIPA) and any other applicable federal or state breach notification laws.
          Notification will be sent to the email address associated with your account as
          promptly as practicable under the circumstances.

          delete your personal information from our primary database within 30 days of
          verifying your request. Residual copies may remain in database backups for a
          limited period until those backups are overwritten or deleted in the normal course
          of operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Server log data is retained for a rolling period determined by our hosting provider

        <p>
          User-generated content created by administrator accounts (such as custom planets or
